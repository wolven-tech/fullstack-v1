# MCP Servers Configuration

This file configures Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced AI assistant capabilities.

## Configured Servers

### Playwright (`@playwright/mcp`)
**Purpose**: Browser automation and end-to-end testing support

**Command**: `bunx @playwright/mcp@latest`

**Capabilities**:
- Run Playwright tests
- Inspect browser automation
- Debug E2E test failures
- Generate test code

**Setup**: No additional configuration required

---

### Sentry (`mcp-server-sentry`)
**Purpose**: Error monitoring and debugging integration

**Command**: `uvx mcp-server-sentry --auth-token ${SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}`

**Capabilities**:
- Query error reports
- Analyze stack traces
- Review issue history
- Monitor application health

**Setup**:
1. Get your Sentry auth token from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
2. Add to your environment variables:
   ```bash
   # In apps/app/.env.local
   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_sentry_token_here
   ```

**Note**: The MCP server reads `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` from your environment variables automatically.

---

### Trigger.dev (`trigger.dev`)
**Purpose**: Background job management and monitoring

**Command**: `bunx trigger.dev@latest mcp`

**Capabilities**:
- Manage background jobs
- Monitor job execution
- Debug job failures
- Query job history

**Setup**: Requires Trigger.dev project configuration (already set up in apps/app)

---

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your environment:

```bash
# Required for Sentry MCP server
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_sentry_token

# Optional but recommended (already in .env.example)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@xxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxx
SENTRY_ORG=your-org
SENTRY_PROJECT=your-project
```

## Usage

These MCP servers are automatically available to AI assistants (like Claude Code) when configured in `.mcp.json`. The AI can use them to:

- Run and debug Playwright tests
- Investigate Sentry errors
- Monitor and manage Trigger.dev jobs

## Troubleshooting

### Sentry MCP not working
- Verify `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is set in your environment
- Check token has correct permissions in Sentry dashboard
- Ensure `uvx` is installed (part of uv package manager)

### Playwright MCP not working
- Ensure Playwright is installed: `bun add -D @playwright/test`
- Verify `bunx` can execute Playwright commands

### Trigger.dev MCP not working
- Check Trigger.dev configuration in `apps/app`
- Verify API credentials are set
- Ensure `bunx` can access `trigger.dev` CLI
